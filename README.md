# Reaper-Save-Compressor
A PowerShell script disguised as an application with included instructions to both save Reaper projects and assets in a contained location, and archive/compress/encrypt the save directory for sharing complete projects over the internet via a single archive file. Uses 7zip and you must have it installed.
